          <p>   
                Historically, most classes of technical documentation lacked
                universal conformity (standards) for format, content and structure.</p>
                <p>Standards are being developed to redress this through
                bodies such as the International Organization for Standardization(ISO),
                which has published standards relating to rules
                for preparation of user guides, manuals, product specifications, etc for technical
                product documentation.</p>
                <p>These standards are covered by ICS 01.110.[1] Technical product documentation not covered by ICS 01.110 are listed in
                the subsection below.</p>

            Some documentation systems are concerned with the overall types or forms of documentation that constitute a
            documentation set, as well as (or rather than) how the documentation is produced, published or formatted.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, the Di√°taxis framework (which is mostly used in the field of software documentation) posits four
            distinct documentation forms, corresponding to four different user needs: tutorials, how-to guides, reference and
            explanation.</p>
        <p>By contrast, DITA asserts five different "topic types": Task, Concept, Reference, Glossary Entry, and
            Troubleshooting, while RedHat's Modular Documentation system uses three "modules": Concept, Procedure and Reference</p>

            <p>if...else statement</p>
            <article>
              Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
              true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
              condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
    
              <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
              condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
              Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
              condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
              statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
              statement, including further nested if statements.
              <p>
                You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
                conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
              </p>
              <code
                >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
                statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
                statement_last; }
              </code>
              In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition
              which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple
              statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
              general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially
              when nesting if statements:
    
              <code
                >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
              >
              It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
              expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when
              glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
              <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use
              an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
              additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
    
              <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
            </article>
          
      <p>While Statement</p>
            
            <article>
              A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
              condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
    
              <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes
              false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to
              the statement following the loop.
    
              <p>
                The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed.
                If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the
                condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
                stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to
                group those statements.
              </p>
    
              Example:
    
              <p>
                The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
              </p>
    
              <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
              <p>
                With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
                Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
              </p>
    
              <ul>
                <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
                true, so the loop terminates.
              </p>
